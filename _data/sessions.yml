  title: "Brain dynamics and flexible behaviors"
  description: "Executive control processes and flexible behaviors rely on the integrity of, and dynamic interactions between, large-scale brain networks. The right insular cortex is a critical component of a salience/midcingulo-insular network that is thought to mediate interactions between brain networks involved in externally oriented (central executive/lateral frontoparietal network) and internally oriented (default mode/medial frontoparietal network) processes. How these brain systems reconfigure with development is a critical question for cognitive neuroscience, with implications for neurodevelopmental pathologies affecting brain connectivity. I will describe studies examining how brain network dynamics support flexible behaviors in typical and atypical development, presenting evidence suggesting a unique role for the dorsal anterior insular from studies of meta-analytic connectivity modeling, dynamic functional connectivity, and structural connectivity. These findings from adults, typically developing children, and children with autism suggest that structural and functional maturation of insular pathways is a critical component of the process by which human brain networks mature to support complex, flexible cognitive processes throughout the lifespan."

  title: "Updates from ENIGMA: Worldwide collaborative methods"
  description: "The Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium is a worldwide, largely volunteer research collaboration that recently celebrated its 10th year. In that time, it has become a model of large-scale, imaging data re-use for meta- and mega-analysis, leading to numerous results in genetic effects on brain structure, clinical effects on brain structure and function, and methods for analysis of heterogenous structural and functional data. Clinical research domains range from schizophrenia to bipolar disorder to Parkinson's disease, sleep disorders, HIV and addiction, while methodological developments span gray matter volumes, subcortical shape, sulcal and gyral depth, white matter tract based statistics, and resting state analyses, with recommendations for applying an ENIGMA approach to task-based fMRI are in development. These efforts highlight both the value of combining data analyses, along with the challenges of combining data from studies collected for different reasons in different environments. I will review some of the current efforts underway across the more than 50 working groups within ENIGMA, along with the implications for these kinds of large-scale analyses in the future."

  title: "Leveraging biological knowledge: From Brain Mapping to predictive models"
  description: "The long predominant paradigm in neuroimaging has been to compare (mean) local volume or activity between groups, or to correlate these to behavioral phenotypes. Such approach, however, is intrinsically limited in terms of possible insight into inter-individual differences and application in clinical practice. Recently, the increasing availability of large cohort data and tools for multivariate statistical learning, allowing the prediction of individual cognitive or clinical phenotypes in new subjects, have started a revolution in imaging neuroscience. 
<br /><br />The transformation of systems neuroscience into a big data discipline poses a lot of new challenges, yet the most critical aspects is the still sub-optimal relationship between the extremely wide feature-space from neuroimaging and the comparably low number of subjects. This, however, is only true when approaching neuroimaging machine-learning in a naïve fashion, i.e., when ignoring the large body of existing work on human brain mapping. The regional segregation of the brain into distinct modules as well as the large-scale, distributed networks provide the fundamental organizational principles of the human brain and hence the basis for cognitive information processing. Importantly, both can now be mapped in a highly robust fashion by integrating information on hundreds or even thousands of individual subjects to provide a priori information. 
<br /><br />This talk will outline the fundamental principles of topographic organization in the human brain and the robust mapping of functional networks. I will then illustrate, how this knowledge on human brain organization can be leveraged for inference on socio-affective or cognitive traits in previously unseen individual subjects or psychopathology in mental disorders. Providing a bidirectional translation, such application will in turn provide information on the respective brain regions and networks."

  title: "New Maps of Activation, Connectivity, and Hierarchy using Ultra High Resolution fMRI"
  description: "Layer fMRI, requiring high field, advanced pulse sequences, and sophisticated processing methods, has emerged in the last decade. The rate of layer fMRI papers published has grown sharply as the delineation of mesoscopic scale functional organization has shown success in providing insight into human brain processing. Layer fMRI promises to move beyond being able to simply identify where and when activation is taking place as inferences made from the activation depth in the cortex will provide detailed directional feedforward and feedback related activity. This new knowledge promises to bridge invasive measures and those typically carried out on humans. In this talk, I will describe the challenges in achieving laminar functional specificity as well as possible approaches to data analysis for both activation studies and resting state connectivity. I will highlight our work demonstrating task-related laminar modulation of primary sensory and motor systems as well as layer-specific activation in dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex with a working memory task. Lastly, I will present recent work demonstrating cortical hierarchy in visual cortex using resting state connectivity laminar profiles."

  title: "Everything you wish to know about critical brain dynamics but are afraid to ask"
  description: '<p>We discuss recent attempts to understand complex brain dynamics at large scale using approaches from statistical physics. The motivation to adopt this approach is rooted in a more general question: "Why life is complex and –most importantly– what is the origin of the over abundance of complexity in nature?" This  fundamental problem “is screaming to be answered but seldom is even being asked”, paraphrasing the late Per Bak.</p>
<p>In this lecture we will justify the approach by reviewing our attempts across several scales to understand the origins of complex biological problems from the perspective of critical phenomena. We will then offer an overview of the experimental and numerical results pertaining to complex aspects of large scale brain dynamics.</p>'

  title: "Disentangling the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain"
  description: "<p>The brain has all of the hallmarks of a complex system, with meaningful activity occurring at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. When measured with resting state fMRI, all of this activity is compressed into a single measurement of the resulting hemodynamic response for each voxel at each time point. However, by leveraging the spatial, temporal and spectral properties of different types of activity, we may be able to identify signatures in the rs-fMRI signal. In this talk, I will describe some of the types of activity that we expect to contribute to the rs-fMRI signal and features that might allow us to selectively extract them for use in research or the clinic.</p>

  title: "Mapping early brain network changes in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders: a longitudinal perspective"
  description: "The spatial patterning of each neurodegenerative disease relates closely to a distinct structural and functional network in the human brain. This talk will mainly describe how brain network-sensitive neuroimaging methods such as resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI can shed light on brain network dysfunctions associated with pathology and cognitive decline from preclinical to clinical dementia. I will first present our findings from two independent datasets on how amyloid and cerebrovascular pathology influence brain functional networks cross-sectionally and longitudinally in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Evidence on longitudinal functional network organizational changes in healthy older adults and the influence of APOE genotype will be presented. In the second part, I will describe our work on how different pathology influences brain structural network and white matter microstructure. I will also touch on some new data on how brain network integrity contributes to behavior and disease progression using multivariate or machine learning approaches. These findings underscore the importance of studying selective brain network vulnerability instead of individual region and longitudinal design. Further developed with machine learning approaches, multimodal network-specific imaging signatures will help reveal disease mechanisms and facilitate early detection, prognosis and treatment search of neuropsychiatric disorders."

  title: "Graph signal processing for computational neuroimaging"
  description: "<p>State-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides unprecedented opportunities to study brain structure (anatomy) and function (physiology). Based on such data, graph representations can be built where nodes are associated to brain regions and edge weights to strengths of structural or functional connections. In particular, structural graphs capture major neural pathways in white matter, while functional graphs map out statistical interdependencies between pairs of regional activity traces. Network analysis of these graphs has revealed emergent system-level properties of brain structure or function, such as efficiency of communication and modular organization.</p>
<p>In this talk, graph signal processing (GSP) will be presented as a novel framework to integrate brain structure, contained in the structural graph, with brain function, characterized by activity traces that can be considered as time-dependent graph signals. Such a perspective allows to define novel meaningful graph-filtering operations of brain activity that take into account smoothness of signals on the anatomical backbone. This allows to define a new measure of “coupling” between structure and function based on how activity is expressed on structural graph harmonics. To provide statistical inference, we also extend the well-known Fourier phase randomization method to generate surrogate data to the graph setting. This new measure reveals a behaviorally relevant spatial gradient, where sensory regions tend to be more coupled with structure, and high-level cognitive ones less so. In addition, we also make a case to introduce the graph modularity matrix at the core of GSP, in order to incorporate knowledge about graph community structure when processing signals on the graph, but without the need for community detection. Finally, recent work will highlight how the spatial resolution of this type of analyses can be increased to the voxel level, representing a few hundredth thousands of nodes.</p>

  title: "Brain Metastability"
  description: "<p>Two paradigms continue to spar in the neuroscience at the local and system levels. At the elemental level of neurons, and grounded in the prominent work of many cellular physiologists including Eccles, Hodgkin and Huxley, overwhelming evidence implicate directional flows of information from functional unit to functional unit. At another system level, and thrusted by giants of system Neuroscience like Freeman, Eckhorn, Gray and Singer, focus is shifted to ensemble activities that yield evidence of functional synchronization. In their extreme forms, both paradigms eschew one important property of complex functional systems. A strictly serial model of synaptic propagation labors to achieve mass action. And a completely collective system presents many roadblocks to a dynamics of its self-organized activities, making for a brain frozen in time and inefficient at adaptation and flexibility. I will place in the reconciliatory middle ground the theory of brain metastability initially pioneered by Kelso. Its spatiotemporal complexity is permissive of information flows at the same time as transient coordination provides collective power at multiple spatial scales. I will provide mathematical bases for its study in models that prepare for the empirical encounter of its phenomenology; I will outline empirical evidence of its pervasiveness. Although metastability is conceptually contiguous with the two aforementioned paradigms, I will describe the pitfalls that follow from analyzing it as approximations of them, and I will argue that a shift in perspective and methods is required to fully understand brain complexity.</p>

Despite their importance and self-evidence, emotions are notoriously difficult to define scientifically. In this talk, I will present research combining approaches from cognitive neuroscience and machine learning to build models of human brain activity that track the engagement of distinct affective processes. I will discuss evidence suggesting that brain representations of emotional states are high-dimensional, distributed, and are inconsistent with intuitive psychological models that organize emotions along a small number of dimensions, such as valence and arousal. Building and validating quantitative models of human brain activity promises to provide insight into the nature of emotion provide novels targets for cognitive and therapeutic interventions.</p>

  title: "Nonlinear Independent Component Analysis, with Applications to EEG/MEG"
  description: "<p>Unsupervised learning, in particular learning general nonlinear representations, is one of the deepest problems in machine learning. Estimating latent quantities in a generative model provides a principled framework, and has been successfully used in the linear case, e.g., with independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse coding. ICA is well established in analysis of brain imaging data. However, extending ICA to the nonlinear case has proven to be extremely difficult: A straight-forward extension is unidentifiable, i.e., it is not possible to recover those latent components that actually generated the data. Here, we show that this problem can be solved by using additional information, in particular in the form of temporal structure.  Our methods are related to 'self-supervised' learning increasingly used in deep learning. Application of such methods to EEG/MEG analysis is a promising avenue for research.</p>

  title: "The Bilingual Brain: Uncovering Neural Architecture for Learning to Read across Languages"
  description: "<p>Learning to read change's mind and brain. How might bilingual experience influence children’s neural architecture for learning to read?  Words have sounds and meanings. The neural architecture for learning to read includes the formation of sound-to-print and meaning-to-print neurocognitive pathways.  Importantly, there is also significant cross-linguistic variation in how children form these associations. In phonologically transparent such as Italian, children develop stronger sound-to-print networks, whereas learners of Chinese form stronger meaning-to-print associations. To understand how bilingual experiences influence children’s developing neural architecture for learning to read we use fNIRS with Spanish-English and Chinese-English bilingual children in the US. Several key findings emerge from these data that we will discuss during the presentation. First, the findings reveal principled bilingual transfer effects of children’s phonological, morphological, and lexical processes for learning to read.  Second, the findings reveal the Universal aspects of literacy development across these typologically-distinct languages. The findings are discussed in light of theoretical perspectives on learning to read, bilingual development, as well as the universal and language-specific aspects of language, literacy, and dyslexia.</p>

  title: "“In the wild“ brain activity decoding"
  description: "<p>To map the neural substrate of mental function, cognitive neuroimaging relies on controlled psychological manipulations that engage brain systems associated with specific cognitive processes. In order to build comprehensive atlases of cognitive function in the brain, it must assemble maps for many different cognitive processes, which often evoke overlapping patterns of activation. Such data aggregation faces contrasting goals: on the one hand finding correspondences across vastly different cognitive experiments, while on the other hand precisely describing the function of any given brain region.</p> 
<p>In this talk I will present two analysis frameworks that tackle these difficulties and thereby enable the generation of brain atlases for cognitive function.  The first one uses deep-learning techniques to extract representations—task-optimized networks—that form a set of basis cognitive dimensions relevant to the psychological manipulations. This approach does not assume any prior knowledge of the commonalities shared by the studies in the corpus; those are inferred during model training.</p> 
<p>The second one leverages ontologies of cognitive concepts and multi-label brain decoding to map the neural substrate of these concepts. Crucially, it can accurately decode the cognitive concepts recruited in new tasks. These results demonstrate that aggregating independent task-fMRI studies can provide a more precise global atlas of selective associations between brain and cognition.</p>

  title: "Altered Central Multisensory Processing in Post-concussion Vestibular Dysfunction"
  description: "<p>Vestibular symptoms are one of the most frequent complaints after concussion and are associated with prolonged recovery. However, the underlying structural and functional alterations underlying post-concussion vestibular dysfunction are not well understood. Furthermore, what constitutes the vestibular network in humans has not been fully elucidated. In this talk, I will review the clinical findings of vestibular impairment following concussion and the current models of central vestibular processing. I will then discuss the data supporting central multisensory processing as the primary driver of subacute and chronic post-concussion vestibular symptoms. Defining the alterations in vestibular processing after head injury will allow better prognostication and more targeted, patient-centric neurorehabilitation therapies.</p>

  title: "Age-related brain changes and risk factors for cognitive decline"
  description: "<p>Functional differences in the default mode network and related memory systems are observed in typical aging. Our research, as an example, shows that particularly functional connectivity within the posterior memory system appears affected by aging. Furthermore, we found that negative subsequent memory effects may differentially support memory performance across the lifespan, suggesting a developmental maturation and age-related decline.</p>
<p>The posterior default mode regions also appear most vulnerable to early Alzheimer’s disease related brain changes. Subjective cognitive decline, the perceived decline in cognitive abilities in the absence of deficits on clinical assessments, is a known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Our work shows that participants with subjective cognitive decline have lower default mode network functional connectivity compared to older adults without, particularly in posterior regions, suggesting possible early functional brain changes in older adults with subjective cognitive decline in similar brain regions as observed in early Alzheimer’s disease. However, as these findings are based on cross-sectional data, they don’t provide insight in actual brain changes in those with subjective cognitive decline. One of our current lines of research aims to address this gap in the literature by examining changes in functional connectivity over a three-year period. In line with our cross-sectional finding, our longitudinal results reveal a steeper decline in default mode network functional connectivity in older adults with subjective cognitive decline than those without.</p>"

  title: "Precision dynamical mapping using topological data analysis reveals a unique hub-like transition state at rest"
  description: "<p>Even in the absence of external stimuli, neural activity is both highly dynamic and organized across multiple spatiotemporal scales. The continuous evolution of brain activity patterns during rest is believed to help maintain a rich repertoire of possible functional configurations that relate to typical and atypical cognitive phenomena. Whether these transitions or “explorations” follow some underlying arrangement or instead lack a predictable ordered plan remains to be determined. Here, using a precision dynamics approach, we aimed at revealing the rules that govern transitions in brain activity at rest at the single participant level. We hypothesized that by revealing and characterizing the overall landscape of whole brain configurations (or states) we could interpret the rules (if any) that govern transitions in brain activity at rest. To generate the landscape of whole-brain configurations we used Topological Data Analysis based Mapper approach. Across all participants, we consistently observed a rich topographic landscape in which the transition of activity from one state to the next involved a central hub-like “transition state.” The hub topography was characterized as a shared attractor-like basin where all canonical resting-state networks were represented equally. The surrounding periphery of the landscape had distinct network configurations. The intermediate transition state and traversal through it via a topographic gradient seemed to provide the underlying structure for the continuous evolution of brain activity patterns at rest. In addition, differences in the landscape architecture were more consistent within than between subjects, providing evidence of idiosyncratic dynamics and potential utility in precision medicine.<p>

  title: "Cross-Frequency Coupling in the Brain"
  description: "<p>Cognitive processing and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized to be the result of frequency specific interactions of specialized but widely distributed cortical regions. Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been proposed to coordinate the neural dynamics between these distinct frequency bands across spatial and temporal scales.  One particular form of CFC known as phase amplitude coupling (PAC) quantifies the interplay between the phase of a slower oscillation and the envelope of a faster oscillation. The existing methods for assessing PAC have some limitations including limited frequency resolution, sensitivity to noise, data length and sampling rate due to the inherent dependence on bandpass filtering. Moreover, most of the current applications of PAC to neuronal data focuses on average coupling within a single channel. In this talk, I will present some recent developments in the computation of PAC. First, I will introduce a new time-frequency based phase-amplitude coupling measure that addresses the biases encountered by Hilbert transform based PAC measures. Next, I will introduce an extension of PAC analysis from the bivariate to the multivariate case allowing us to look at whole brain cross-frequency coupling networks. Finally, I will present applications of these new PAC computation tools on EEG data collected during error monitoring.</p>

  title: "The lure of misleading causal statements in functional connectivity research"
  description: "<p>As neuroscientists we want to understand how causal interactions or mechanisms within the brain give rise to perception, cognition, and behavior. It is typical to estimate interaction effects from measured activity using statistical techniques such as functional connectivity, Granger Causality, or information flow, whose outcomes are often falsely treated as revealing mechanistic insight. Since these statistical techniques fit models to low-dimensional measurements from brains, they ignore the fact that brain activity is high-dimensional. Here we focus on the obvious confound of common inputs: the countless unobserved variables likely have more influence than the few observed ones. Any given observed correlation can be explained by an infinite set of causal models that take into account the unobserved variables. Therefore, correlations within massively undersampled measurements tell us little about mechanisms. We argue that these mis-inferences of causality from correlation are augmented by an implicit redefinition of words that suggest mechanisms, such as connectivity, causality, and flow.</p>

  title: "Turbulence in Human Brain Dynamics"
  description: "<p>Turbulence is a special dynamical state driving many physical systems by way of its ability to facilitate fast energy/information transfer across scales. These qualities are important for brain function, but it is currently unknown if the brain also exhibits turbulence as a fundamental organisational principle. Using large-scale neuroimaging empirical data from 1003 healthy participants, we demonstrate amplitude turbulence in human brain dynamics. Furthermore, we build a whole-brain model with coupled oscillators to demonstrate that the best fit of our model to the data corresponds to a region of maximally developed amplitude turbulence, which also corresponds to maximal sensitivity to the processing of external stimulations (information capability). The model shows the economy of anatomy by following the Exponential Distance Rule of anatomical connections as a cost-of-wiring principle. This establishes a firm link between turbulence and optimal brain function. Overall, our results reveal a novel way of analysing and modelling whole-brain dynamics that for the first time ever establishes turbulence as a fundamental basic principle of brain organisation.</p>

  title: "Toward causality in the brain: from lesions to psychedelics"
  description: "<p>The recent explosion of neuroimaging studies in large-scale populations of humans has begin to reveal complex mappings between brain and behavior. Cross-sectional studies do not allow, however, for exploring causality in the brain. Lesion studies have historically allowed direct linking between an area of damage and a specific behavioral change, and more recent virtual lesion (TMS), ECoG and pharmacological experiments have allowed exploration of the effect of manipulating brain function on behavior. These type of studies take steps in the direction of understanding causality in brain-behavior relationships. In her talk, Amy will discuss recent work in this area and present some of her own work studying the effect of damage on both brain structure/function and behavior, how the brain recovers from damage and how psychedelics may impact whole-brain function.</p>

  description: "<p>As the field of music cognition is rapidly burgeoning, researchers are beginning to consider how the unique amalgam of scientific and humanistic study of music may translate towards large-scale interventions that may improve cognition for many, including but not limited to people from neurodiverse populations. In this talk I will examine novel ways in which music cognition research may help improve cognition, in ways that move away from overused tropes (e.g. the Mozart Effect) towards future directions of use-inspired music cognition research. As use cases, I will describe some recent studies in my lab that capitalize on new musical technology, developed from first principles from music cognition research, to help those with attention deficits, memory disorders, and Parkinson's Disease. Our results show how music cognition can help refine and target music-based interventions for multiple special populations, by pinpointing ways in which music capitalizes on fundamental operating characteristics of the brain.</p>

  description: "<p>As advances in technology allow the acquisition of complementary information, it is common for scientific studies to collect multiple datasets. In this talk, we will examine two approaches to data integration. In the first part, we will analyze the joint and individual structure in cognitive assessments and brain morphometry from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We introduce probabilistic joint and individual variation (ProJIVE), which extends probabilistic PCA to multiple datasets. ProJIVE reveals links between brain regions and cognitive performance. In the second part of this talk, we introduce Simultaneous Non-Gaussian component analysis (SING) in which dimension reduction and feature extraction are achieved simultaneously. Instead of maximizing variance using PCA, SING maximizes non-Gaussianity to extract a lower-dimensional subspace and reveal new insights. We apply our method to a working memory task and resting-state correlations from the Human Connectome Project. We find joint structure as evident from learned spatial correspondence. Moreover, some of the subject scores are related to fluid intelligence.</p>

In this talk, I will share the research experience on representation of human brain commonality and individuality using neuroimaging data in the Cortical Architecture Imaging and Discovery Lab at the University of Georgia in the past decade. I will introduce the opportunities and challenges in creating a universal and individualized brain reference system that encodes functional localizations of brain structures by fiber connection patterns and topographic folding patterns, which possess finer granularity, better functional homogeneity, more accurate functional localization, and intrinsically established correspondence across different brains.</p>

  title: "Gamer in the scanner: imitation of human video gameplay and fMRI brain activity using artificial neural networks"
  description: "Artificial neural networks can successfully play video games, yet these AI agents have difficulty adapting to changes in the game environment, or transfer knowledge across different games. As human players can efficiently transfer skills across environments, the Courtois NeuroMod team is working to align the representations of artificial neural networks with human players [1]. We first designed and validated a fully MRI-compatible video game controller [2]. The data collected for this project are part of an extremely deep individual fMRI sample currently featuring up to 140 hours of fMRI per subject (N=6), made available for the community as part of the Courtois NeuroMod data bank (https://cneuromod.ca). We successfully trained artificial agents to imitate the actions of humans playing the game “Shinobi III: revenge of the ninja master” and found that the internal representations of the agents could be used to effectively predict individual brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging [3]. This work could open new avenues to train robust AI video game characters, and gain new insights in brain representations for active and complex stimuli."

  title: "Quantitative, Multidimensional MR Spectroscopic Imaging by Integrating Spin Physics and Machine Learning"
  description: "<p> While neuroimaging has transformed neuroscience by allowing us to map detailed 
in vivo structural and functional organizations of human brain, technologies to 
probe the rich molecular complexity and underpinnings of brain functions in vivo 
are lacking. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows for 
multiplexed molecular imaging and metabolic profiling of the brain in vivo, but its 
applications have been limited by low sensitivity, poor spatial resolution, slow 
imaging speed and challenges in separating molecular signals of interest. In this 
talk, I will discuss our efforts in addressing these challenges. Specifically, I will 
present our progresses on achieving simultaneous, high-resolution mapping of 
metabolites, neurotransmitters, and their biophysical parameters using a 
quantitative multidimensional MRSI approach that builds on and expanding a 
subspace imaging framework. I will also discuss how we integrate physics-based 
modeling and machine learning to address the limitations of subspace modeling. 
Finally, I will discuss our collaborative efforts on clinical translations of the new 
imaging technology. We expect these developments to create new tools to help 
better understand the molecular basis of brain function and diseases, improve 
diagnosis and treatment assessment.</p>

  title: "Topological inference for brain networks in temporal lobe epilepsy using the Wasserstein distance"
  description: " <p> Persistent homology summarizes the changes of topological structures in data through over 
  multiple scales called filtrations. Doing so detect hidden topological signals that persist over different scales.
   However, a key obstacle of applying persistent homology to brain networks has been the lack of robust statistical 
   inference framework. To address this problem, we present a new topological inference procedure based on the 
   Wasserstein distance. Our approach has no explicit models and statistical distributional 
   assumptions. The inference is performed in a completely data driven fashion. Our metric-based 
   inference significantly differs from traditional feature-based topological data analysis (TDA). 
   The method is applied to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRI) of the 
   temporal lobe epilepsy patients and able to localize brain regions that contribute the most to topological 
   differences. We made computer code available at <a href = 'https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/dynamicTDA'> Github </a>.

  title: "From searching for lesions to exploring distributed circuitopathy in psychosis."
  description: " <p> Researchers have sought for more than 100 years for a lesion (or lesions) that might lead to schizophrenia, the major psychotic disorder. Early imaging modalities revealed enlarged ventricles, which imply reduced brain volumes, but no characteristic cortical pathology was identified. High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), finally provided a tool to identify cortical volume loss in vivo. Volumetric studies revealed not only initial gray matter loss in temporal and frontal cortices, but progressive loss after the emergence of psychosis. Advances in 3D microscopy in post-mortem studies indicated increased packing density of cortical pyramidal cells and reduced dendritic arborization in schizophrenia, leading to the idea that the disease reflected dendrotoxicity. Although specific areas (such as frontal and temporal cortex) showed more robust volume loss, the idea that schizophrenia reflected a dysconnectivity among brain regions emerged. Volumetric studies suggested that the areas with greatest loss were areas with the most extensive connectivity – heteromodal cortices or areas that served as hubs. Recently, thought has focused on structural and functional dysconnectivity in schizophrenia, with the emerging concept of the disorder being one of circuitopathy. Decomposing source-activity from high-temporal resolution methods such as EEG and MEG into spectral components allows for functional and effective connectivity measures between areas. Methods for spectral effective connectivity still need development and validation. Issues include reliable and valid source localization, methods for data reduction (particularly parcellation), identification of critical frequency bands underlying inter-areal communication, and derivation of networks from whole brain data. Data and approaches from my laboratory will be used to illustrate our approaches, and how spectral connectivity indicates alpha-band and theta-band dysconnectivity between cortical areas are central deficits in psychosis, even early in disease course at the emergence of psychosis.</p>

  title: "Neuroimaging of affect and motivation: Pathways, models, and interventions."
  description: "Affect and motivation — pleasure and pain, desire and threat — are central to human life. Their experience defines our wellbeing, and the brain processes that underlie them drive behavior and learning. Developing models of the brain circuits that underlie them, and how they interact, could transform how we understand and measure them, and provide biological targets for interventions ranging from drugs to psychotherapy. Neuroimaging, including Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is playing a transformative role in our ability to model the brain bases of affective and motivational processes. However, developing such models will require computational advances, particularly in our ability to model how emergent properties like pain arise from complex interactions among brain systems. In this talk, I describe a series of studies that combine fMRI imaging with statistical and machine learning to develop measures that are sensitive and specific for particular types of pain and affect and generalizable across diverse populations. These studies provide a brain-based picture of the organization of pain and affect, revealing both distinctions and similarities that are not predicted by folk psychological theories. We find that on one hand, pain and other affective states are distributed, relying on interactions across multiple brain systems. At the same time, however, new techniques provide ways of decomposing these systems into particular pathways that can be referenced to animal models and targeted by interventions."

  title: "Understand the Brain Using Interpretable Machine Learning Models"
  description: " <p> Computational neuroscience is a burgeoning field embracing exciting scientific questions, a deluge of data, an imperative demand for quantitative models, and a close affinity with artificial intelligence. These opportunities promote the advancement of data-driven machine learning methods to help neuroscientists deeply understand our brains. In particular, my work lies in such an interdisciplinary field and spans the development of scientifically-motivated probabilistic modeling approaches for neural and behavior analyses. In this talk, I will first present my work on developing Bayesian methods to identify latent manifold structures with applications to neural recordings in multiple cortical areas. The models are able to reveal the underlying signals of neural populations as well as uncover interesting topography of neurons where there is a lack of knowledge and understanding about the brain. Discovering such low-dimensional signals or structures can help shed light on how information is encoded at the population level, and provide significant scientific insight into the brain. Next, I will talk about probabilistic priors that encourage region-sparse activation for brain decoding. The proposed model provides spatial decoding weights for brain imaging data that are both more interpretable and achieve higher decoding performance. Finally, I will introduce a series of works on semi-supervised learning for animal behavior analysis and understanding. I will show that when we have a very limited amount of human-labeled data, the semi-supervised learning frameworks can well resolve the scarce data issue by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in the context of pose tracking, video understanding, and behavioral segmentation. By actively working on both neural and behavioral studies, I hope to develop interpretable machine learning and Bayesian statistical approaches to understanding neural systems integrating extensive and complex behaviors, thus providing a systematic understanding of neural mechanisms and biological functions. </p>
