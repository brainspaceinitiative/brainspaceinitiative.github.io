  bio: "I am a data scientist with a passion for the development and application of statistical and computational methods to understand and solve complex problems. I have a strong background in digital signal processing, training and research experience with unsupervised and supervised learning methods, experience with data wrangling and data cleaning of large (>2TB) data sets, and with the execution of experiments in high-performance clusters using Slurm and batch scripts. I also have extensive experience as a Linux user and administrator. In general, I like to strike a balance between a solid theoretical understanding of the mathematical methods and the software development needed to solve problems."

  As a person and scientist, I am passionate about understanding and identifying solutions for problems of engineering, mathematics, neuroscience and philosophy.
  In my present work, I am applying control theory onto the brain activity network for tackling epilepsy. My background is in Mechatronics Engineering and Control Theory, having graduated at the University of Manchester, UK. I have worked with deep learning networks on neuroscience and nonlinear control challenges."
