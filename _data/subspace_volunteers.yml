  bio: "I have studied Electronics and Communication Engineering at the Politecnico of Torin (IT) and I am now at my last year of the Master degree in Electrical Engineering at Delft University of Technology (NL). I am working with EEG signals for the detection of Epilepsy, using graph signal processing. My interests are multiple and they lie at the intersection of neuroscience, signal processing and machine learning. After my Master I aim to pursue a Ph.D focusing on Epilepsy prediction or detection. I am super excited of being part of this group and cannot wait for the opportunity to grow and learn new things together!:grinning:"

  bio: "I am a data scientist with a passion for the development and application of statistical and computational methods to understand and solve complex problems. I have a strong background in digital signal processing, training and research experience with unsupervised and supervised learning methods, experience with data wrangling and data cleaning of large (>2TB) data sets, and with the execution of experiments in high-performance clusters using Slurm and batch scripts. I also have extensive experience as a Linux user and administrator. In general, I like to strike a balance between a solid theoretical understanding of the mathematical methods and the software development needed to solve problems."

  <br><br> 
  
  As a person and scientist, I am passionate about understanding and identifying solutions for problems of engineering, mathematics, neuroscience and philosophy.
  In my present work, I am applying control theory onto the brain activity network for tackling epilepsy. My background is in Mechatronics Engineering and Control Theory, having graduated at the University of Manchester, UK. I have worked with deep learning networks on neuroscience and nonlinear control challenges."

  title: "Postdoctoral researcher"
  team: true
  bio: "I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Joana Pereira at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institute in Sweden. I obtained my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Nanotechnology from Bilkent University, Turkey, studying the emergent collective behaviors from the interaction of autonomous mobile individuals. 

  <br><br> 
  
  Currently, I use complex networks as a tool to model the complex brain connectivity patterns that arise due to the interaction between distributed brain regions. The goal of my studies is to design more efficient and sensitive methods to understand the alterations of these complex brain networks in individuals with neurodegenerative disorders. Ultimately, the developed methods can have immense value as prognostic markers, e.g. to achieve earlier and more accurate diagnosis, identify patients with worse prognosis or assess the effects of treatment on brain connectivity."
